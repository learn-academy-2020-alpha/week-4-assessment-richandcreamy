# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable is invoked when a class is used to create a new object.  

  Researched answer: Instance variables begin with an at sign (@) and can be referenced only within class methods. They differ from local variables in that they don't exist within any particular scope. Instance variables live within a class instance, so as long as that instance stays alive, so will the instance variables.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: Onjects with privacy features.

  Researched answer: In Ruby, a block is a chunk of code that you pass as an argument to a method and sits between curly braces or a do-end statement.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: It is implied you want a return in your code. You don't need to write "Return" in your code.

  Researched answer: Any statement in Ruby returns the value of the last evaluated expression. 



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object oriented programming is thinking and using code with objects and classes. Functional programming does not have objects as the primary focus of its code.

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming carries out tasks through the use of objects rather than actions. In object-oriented programming, information is organized into independently functioning groups called objects. These objects interact with one another, and one object can absorb the characteristics of another. 

  The main difference between the functional programming paradigm and other paradigms is that functional programs use math functions rather than statements to express ideas. 

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint you can make objects from. 

  Researched answer: Classes and objects from the essential part of Object-oriented programming, where a class can be considered as a construct that encapsulates a group of variables and methods; whereas, an object acts as member or instance of that class.
